    /// <remarks>
    /// Each system that uses the EntityCommandBuffer provided by a command buffer system must call
    /// <see cref="CreateCommandBuffer"/> to create its own command buffer instance. This buffer system executes each of
    /// these separate command buffers in the order that you created them. The commands are executed during this system's
    /// <see cref="OnUpdate"/> function.
    ///
    /// When you write to a command buffer from a Job, you must add the <see cref="JobHandle"/> of that Job to the buffer
    /// system's dependency list with <see cref="AddJobHandleForProducer"/>.
    ///
    /// If you write to a command buffer from a Job that runs in
    /// parallel (and this includes both <see cref="IJobForEach{T0}"/> and <see cref="IJobChunk"/>), you must use the
    /// concurrent version of the command buffer (<seealso cref="EntityCommandBuffer.ToConcurrent"/>).
    ///
    /// Executing the commands in an EntityCommandBuffer invokes the corresponding functions of the
    /// <see cref="EntityManager"/>. Any structural change, such as adding or removing entities, adding or removing
    /// components from entities, or changing shared component values, creates a sync-point in your application.
    /// At a sync point, all Jobs accessing entity components must complete before new Jobs can start. Such sync points
    /// make it difficult for the Job scheduler to fully utilize available computing power. To avoid sync points,
    /// you should use as few entity command buffer systems as possible.
    ///
    /// The default ECS <see cref="World"/> code creates a <see cref="ComponentSystemGroup"/> setup with
    /// three main groups, <see cref="InitializationSystemGroup"/>, <see cref="SimulationSystemGroup"/>, and
    /// <see cref="PresentationSystemGroup"/>. Each of these main groups provides an existing EntityCommandBufferSystem
    /// executed at the start and the end of other, child systems.
    ///
    /// Note that unused command buffers systems do not create sync points because there are no commands to execute and
    /// thus no structural changes created.
    ///
    /// The EntityCommandBufferSystem class is abstract, so you must implement a subclass to create your own
    /// entity command buffer system. However, none of its methods are abstract, so you do not need to implement
    /// your own logic. Typically, you create an EntityCommandBufferSystem subclass to create a named buffer system
