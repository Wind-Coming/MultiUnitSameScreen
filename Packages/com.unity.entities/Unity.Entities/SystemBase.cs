    /// ### Systems in ECS
    ///
    /// A typical system operates on a set of entities that have specific components. The system identifies
    /// the components of interest, reading and writing data, and performing other entity operations as appropriate.
    ///
    /// The following example shows a basic system that iterates over entities using a [Entities.ForEach] construction.
    /// In this  example, the system iterates over all entities with both a Displacement and a Velocity component and
    /// updates the Displacement based on the delta time elapsed since the last frame.
    ///
    /// <example>
    /// <code source="../DocCodeSamples.Tests/SystemBaseExamples.cs" region="basic-system" title="Basic System Example"/>
    /// </example>
    ///
    /// #### System lifecycle callbacks
    ///
    /// You can define a set of system lifecycle event functions when you implement a system. The runtime invokes these
    /// functions in the following order:
    ///
    /// * <see cref="ComponentSystemBase.OnCreate"/> -- called when the system is created.
    /// * <see cref="ComponentSystemBase.OnStartRunning"/> -- before the first OnUpdate and whenever the system resumes
    ///   running.
    /// * <see cref="OnUpdate"/> -- every frame as long as the system has work to do (see
    ///   <see cref="ComponentSystemBase.ShouldRunSystem"/>) and the system is <see cref="ComponentSystemBase.Enabled"/>.
    /// * <see cref="ComponentSystemBase.OnStopRunning"/> -- whenever the system stops updating because it finds no
    ///   entities matching its queries. Also called before OnDestroy.
    /// * <see cref="ComponentSystemBase.OnDestroy"/> -- when the system is destroyed.
    ///
    /// All of these functions are executed on the main thread. To perform work on background threads, you can schedule
    /// jobs from the <see cref="SystemBase.OnUpdate"/> function.
    ///
    /// #### System update order
    ///
    /// The runtime executes systems in the order determined by their <seealso cref="ComponentSystemGroup"/>. Place a system
    /// in a group using <seealso cref="UpdateInGroupAttribute"/>. Use <seealso cref="UpdateBeforeAttribute"/> and
    /// <seealso cref="UpdateAfterAttribute"/> to specify the execution order within a group.
    ///
    /// If you do not explicitly place a system in a specific group, the runtime places it in the default <see cref="World"/>
    /// <see cref="SimulationSystemGroup"/>. By default, all systems are discovered, instantiated, and added to the
    /// default World. You can use the <seealso cref="DisableAutoCreationAttribute"/> to prevent a system from being
    /// created automatically.
    ///
    /// #### Entity queries
    ///
    /// A system caches all queries created through an [Entities.ForEach] construction, through
    /// [ComponentSystemBase.GetEntityQuery], or through [ComponentSystemBase.RequireForUpdate]. By default,
    /// the runtime only calls a system's `OnUpdate()` function when one of these cached queries finds entities. You
    /// can use the <seealso cref="AlwaysUpdateSystemAttribute"/> to have the system always update. Note that a system
    /// with no queries is also updated every frame.
    ///
    /// #### Entities.ForEach and Job.WithCode constructions
    ///
    /// The <see cref="Entities"/> property provides a convenient mechanism for iterating over entity
    /// data. Using an [Entities.ForEach] construction, you can define your entity query, specify a lambda function
    /// to run for each entity, and either schedule the work to be done on a background thread or execute the work
    /// immediately on the main thread.
    ///
    /// The [Entities.ForEach] construction uses a C# compiler extension to take a data query syntax that describes
    /// your intent and translate it into efficient (optionally) job-based code.
    ///
    /// The <see cref="Job"/> property provides a similar mechanism for defining a [C# Job]. You can only use
    /// `Schedule()`to run a [Job.WithCode] construction, which executes the lambda function as a single job.
    ///
    /// #### System attributes
    ///
    /// You can use a number of attributes on your SystemBase implementation to control when it updates:
    ///
    /// * <seealso cref="UpdateInGroupAttribute"/> -- place the system in a <seealso cref="ComponentSystemGroup"/>.
    /// * <seealso cref="UpdateBeforeAttribute"/> -- always update the system before another system in the same group.
    /// * <seealso cref="UpdateAfterAttribute"/> -- always update the system after another system in the same group.
    /// * <seealso cref="AlwaysUpdateSystemAttribute"/> -- invoke `OnUpdate` every frame.
    /// * <seealso cref="DisableAutoCreationAttribute"/> -- do not create the system automatically.
    /// * <seealso cref="AlwaysSynchronizeSystemAttribute"/> -- force a [sync point](xref:sync-points) before invoking
    ///   `OnUpdate`.

        /// property manually to make sure that later systems receive the correct job dependencies.
        ///
        /// The following <see cref="OnUpdate"/> function illustrates manual dependency management. The function uses
        /// two [Entity.ForEach] constructions that schedule jobs which do not depend upon each other, only the incoming

        /// * **`WithAny`** -- An entity must have one or more of these component types.
        ///
        /// * **`WithNone`** -- An entity must not have any of these component types.
        ///
        /// * **`WithChangeFilter()`** -- Only selects entities in chunks in which the specified component might have
        ///   changed since the last time this system instance updated.
        ///
        /// * **`WithSharedComponentFilter(ISharedComponentData)`** -- Only select chunks that have a specified value
        ///   for a shared component.
        ///
        /// * **`WithEntityQueryOptions(EntityQueryOptions)`** -- Specify additonal options defined in a
        ///   <see cref="EntityQueryOptions"/> object.
        ///
        /// * **`WithStoreEntityQueryInField(EntityQuery)`** -- Stores the <see cref="EntityQuery"/> object generated
        ///   by the Entities.ForEach in an EntityQuery field on your system. You can use this EntityQuery object for
        ///   such purposes as getting the number of entities that will be selected by the query. Note that this function
        ///   assigns the EntityQuery instance to your field
        ///   when the system is created. This means that you can use the query before the first execution of the
        ///   lambda function.
        ///
        /// ##### **Defining the lambda function**
        ///
        /// Define the lambda function inside the `ForEach()` method of the entities property. When the system invokes the
        /// lambda function, it assigns values to the function parameters based on the current entity. You can pass ECS
        /// component types as parameters as well as a set of special, named parameters.
        ///
        /// 1. Parameters passed-by-value first (no parameter modifiers)
        /// 2. Writable parameters second(`ref` parameter modifier)
        /// 3. Read-only parameters last(`in` parameter modifier)
        ///
        /// All components should use either the `ref` or the `in` parameter modifier keywords.
        ///
        /// You can pass up to eight parameters to the lambda function. In addition to ECS component types, you can use
        /// the following:
        ///
        /// * **`Entity entity`** — the Entity instance of the current entity. (The parameter can be named anything as
        ///   long as the type is Entity.)
        ///
        /// * **`int entityInQueryIndex`** — the index of the entity in the list of all entities selected by the query.
        ///   Use the entity index value when you have a [native array] that you need to fill with a unique value for
        ///   each entity. You can use the entityInQueryIndex as the index in that array. The entityInQueryIndex should
        ///   also be used as the jobIndex for adding commands to a concurrent <see cref="EntityCommandBuffer"/>.
        ///
        /// * **`int nativeThreadIndex`** — a unique index for the thread executing the current iteration of the
        ///   lambda function. When you execute the lambda function using Run(), nativeThreadIndex is always zero.
        ///
        /// <example>
        /// <code source="../DocCodeSamples.Tests/SystemBaseExamples.cs" region="lambda-params" title="Lambda Parameters"/>
        /// </example>
        ///
        /// ##### **Capturing variables**
        ///
        /// You can capture local variables in the lambda function. When you execute the function using a job (by
        /// calling `ScheduleParallel()` or `ScheduleSingle()` instead of `Run()`) there are some restrictions on the
        /// captured variables and how you use them:
        ///
        /// * Only native containers and blittable types can be captured.
        /// * A job can only write to captured variables that are native containers.
        ///   (To “return” a single value, create a [native array] with one element.)
        ///
        /// You can use the following functions to apply modifiers and attributes to the captured [native container]
        /// variables, including [native arrays]. See [Job.WithCode] for a list of these modifiers and attributes.
        ///
        /// ##### **Executing the lambda function**
        ///
        /// To execute a ForEach construction, you have three options:
        ///
        /// * **`ScheduleParallel()`** -- schedules the work to be done in parallel using the [C# Job] system. Each
        ///   parallel job instance processes at least one chunk of entities at a time. In other words, if all the
        ///   selected entities are in the same chunk, then only one job instance is spawned.
        ///
        /// * **`Schedule()`** -- schedules the work to be done in a single job (no matter how many entities are
        ///   selected).
        ///
        /// * **`Run()`** -- evaluates the entity query and invokes the lambda function for each selected entity
        ///   immediately on the main thread. Calling `Run()` completes the system <see cref="Dependency"/> [JobHandle]
        ///   before running, blocking the main thread, if necessary, while it waits for those jobs to finish.
        ///
        /// When you call Schedule() or ScheduleParallel() without parameters, then the scheduled jobs use the current
        /// value of <see cref="Dependency"/>. You can also pass a [JobHandle] to these functions to define the dependencies
        /// of the scheduled job. In this case, the Entities.forEach construction returns a new [JobHandle] that adds the
        /// scheduled job to the passed in [JobHandle]. See <see cref="Dependency"/> for more information.
        ///
        /// ##### **Additional options**
        ///
        /// * **`WithName(string)`** -— assigns the specified string as the name of the generated job class. Assigning
        ///   a name is optional, but can help identify the function when debugging and profiling.
        /// * **`WithStructuralChanges()`** -— executes the lambda function on the main thread and disables Burst so
        ///   that you can make structural changes to your entity data within the function. For better performance, use
        ///   an <see cref="EntityCommandBuffer"/> instead.
        /// * **`WithoutBurst()`** —- disables Burst compilation. Use this function when your lambda function contains
        ///   code not supported by Burst or while debugging.
        /// * **`WithBurst(FloatMode, FloatPrecision, bool)`** — sets options for the Burst compiler:
        ///    * **floatMode** —- sets the floating point math optimization mode.Fast mode executes faster, but
        ///      produces larger floating point error than Strict mode.Defaults to Strict. See [Burst FloatMode].
        ///    * **floatPrecision** —- sets the floating point math precision. See [Burst FloatPrecision].
        ///    * **synchronousCompilation** —- compiles the function immediately instead of scheduling the function
        ///      for compilation later.
