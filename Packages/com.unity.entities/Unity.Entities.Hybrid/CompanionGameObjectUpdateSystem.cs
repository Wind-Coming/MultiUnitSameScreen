/*
 * Hybrid Components are classic Unity components that are added to an entity via AddComponentObject.
 * We call Companion GameObject the GameObject owned by an entity in order to host those Hybrid Components.
 * Companion GameObjects should be considered implementation details and are not intended to be directly accessed by users.
 * An entity can also have Hybrid Components owned externally (this is used during conversion), but this is not what the system below is about.
 * When an entity owns a Companion GameObject, the entity also has a managed CompanionLink, which contains a reference to that GameObject.
 * Companion GameObjects are in world space, their transform is updated from their entities, never the other way around.
 * Getting to the Companion GameObject from an Entity is done through the managed CompanionLink.
 * Going the other way around, from the Companion GameObject to the Entity, isn't possible nor advised.
