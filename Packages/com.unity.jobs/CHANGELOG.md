### New Features

* IJobParallelForDeferred has been added to allow a parallel for job to be scheduled even if it's for each count will only be known during another jobs execution.

### Upgrade guide

Now you need to explicitly implement IJobParallelForDeferred if you want to use the deferred schedule parallel for.
